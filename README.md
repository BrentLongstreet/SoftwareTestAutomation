# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is function and secure by utilizing unit testing to check its creditability and performance. I can create optimal code that follows the software requirements and create tests that check its functionality and security by analyzing the dependency errors and coverage of the test. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs and incorprate them into a progam by fully grapsing and acknowledging the software requirements and implementing optimal code that covers their needs. I do so while keeping in mind the functionality and security of the system's code and output.


# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by first analzying the software requirements and creating the software's shell with them in mind. Security and functionality are the most vital components to having an succesfull and optimal software. I ensure the software is not exploitable and runs at optimal speed by performing dependency checks and tests.
